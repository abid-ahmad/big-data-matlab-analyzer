# üìä MATLAB Interactive Big-Data Analysis ‚Äî COVID-19 Dataset

An interactive **MATLAB** application for exploring, analyzing, visualizing, and performing regression on a **large dataset (‚â• 2,000 rows)** ‚Äî all through a **simple menu-driven interface**.  
Originally developed as an **Extra Credit Project** for *BE 1500 (Fall 2024)*.

## üí° Highlights
- Works out-of-the-box with the included **COVID-19 dataset**.
- Fully interactive ‚Äî **no code editing required**.
- End-to-end workflow: *load data ‚Üí explore ‚Üí visualize ‚Üí fit regression ‚Üí export results*.

## üìå Overview
- **Automatic dataset loading** from `covid_dataset.csv` (or `covid_dataset.xlsx`)
- **Interactive menu UI** ‚Äî no manual code edits required
- **Modular user-defined functions** for stats, prediction, visualization, and regression
- **End-to-end workflow:** describe ‚Üí predict ‚Üí visualize ‚Üí fit curve ‚Üí (optionally) export

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

### 1) Descriptive Statistics
Calculates:
- **Total** new cases  
- **Mean** new cases (handles missing values)  
- **Min / Max / Range** of new cases

> Output is printed neatly to the MATLAB Command Window.

### 2) Trend Prediction
Simple signal-based prediction using historical averages:
- **Average New Cases (Overall)**
- **Predicted New Cases (Next Day)**
- **Average New Deaths (Overall)**
- **Predicted New Deaths (Next Day)**

### 3) Visualization
Generates multiple plots to explore trends:
- **2D Line Plot:** New COVID-19 cases over time  
- **Bar Chart:** New deaths over time  
- **3D Scatter:** Cases vs. deaths vs. days

### 4) Regression Curve Fitting
- Fits a **linear regression** to COVID-19 cases vs. time  
- Overlays **actual vs. fitted** line on the same plot (with legend, labels, and grid)

## üß± File Architecture

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `main.m` | **Entry point** ‚Äî loads data and shows the interactive menu |
| `descriptive_stats.m` | Computes total, mean, min, max, and range of new cases |
| `predict_model.m` | Computes overall averages and **next-day** predictions |
| `visualize_results.m` | Creates **2D**, **bar**, and **3D** plots |
| `fit_regression_curve.m` | Fits and plots a **linear regression** curve |
| `covid_dataset.csv` (or `covid_dataset.xlsx`) | COVID-19 dataset used by the program |

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. **Download the Project Archive**  
   - Click here to download: [üì¶ MATLAB_Regression_Project_BE1500.zip](report/MATLAB_Regression_Project_BE1500.zip)  
   - Extract the ZIP file to a location on your computer.

2. **Keep the Folder Structure Intact**  
   - Do **not** move or rename individual files after extraction.  
   - All files must remain together in the same folder as provided in the `.zip`.

3. **Open the Project in MATLAB**  
   - Launch MATLAB.  
   - In the **Current Folder** panel, navigate to the extracted project folder.

4. **Run the Main Script**  
   - Locate the main script file (e.g., `main.m`).  
   - Press the **Run** button

5. **Follow the On-Screen Menu**  
   - Use the interactive menu to explore data, create visualizations, and perform regression analysis.
